# Changelog

## Unreleased

- New: `checkpoint_info(path)` inspects an existing checkpoint without loading
  pickled result values. The frozen `CheckpointInfo` reports schema and semantic
  versions, task signature, persisted row count, and primary-file size. It opens
  SQLite read-only and preserves crash-left WAL visibility; `completed` is a row
  count, not total progress, and inspection does not validate against a live
  function.
- New: `item_key=` adds a `str`/`int`/`bytes` application identity to
  `ItemResult.key` across sync and async map, starmap, streaming, callbacks,
  and collected `.item_results()`. `index` remains the ordering contract and
  duplicate application keys are allowed. On checkpointed maps,
  `checkpoint_key=` supplies the result key automatically when `item_key` is
  omitted, reusing the single key evaluation for live and cached results.
- New: collected APIs accept `on_result=` — a live callback receiving each
  success or failure as an `ItemResult` on the driver thread, in completion
  order. Retry metadata is preserved, checkpoint hits report `attempts=0`,
  callback exceptions propagate like `on_progress`, and async callers that
  need awaited handling remain on `async_parallel_iter`.
- New: **production golden template**
  (`examples/07_production_api_job.py`) — every recommended pattern in
  one runnable, zero-credential file: shared client + `Limiter`,
  `Retry.for_http`, checkpoint with stable key and version, `max_errors`,
  SIGTERM/SIGINT → `StopToken`, and explicit `RunStatus` handling of
  partial results. Self-asserting; CI runs it against the built wheel,
  and a subprocess integration test protects the interrupt/resume
  contract the clean run can't see: a real SIGINT must exit `130` with
  the checkpoint intact, and the rerun must hit the server only for the
  remainder (both defects existed in the first draft — caught by
  adversarial review, now regression-tested).
- Docs: **three new pages** — "Which API Should I Use?" (one decision
  tree for the whole surface), a testing guide (deterministic tests
  without sleeps or real HTTP; every `RunStatus` manufactured cheaply),
  and a troubleshooting page (symptom-first entries for 429s-despite-
  limits, pool pauses, checkpoint refusals, pickling, provisional
  totals, truncation raises). All code blocks pass the executable-docs
  gates like the rest of the site.
- Docs: `examples/README.md` caught up with the library — it now covers
  `resilience_demo.py` and the new golden template.
- Planning: post-1.0 feature candidates consolidated into
  [#32](https://github.com/oneryalcin/pyarallel/issues/32) and linked
  from the roadmap; 1.0 remains feature-frozen.

## 0.10.0 — 2026-07-11 — prove and package

- New: **committed benchmark lab** (`benchmarks/bench.py`) — the
  free-threading/interpreter performance numbers (1.0×/2.4× thread
  scaling, 3.4× interpreter-over-threads on a GIL build, worker
  start-up, O(n) engine overhead) used to rest on throwaway scripts run
  once on one machine. Now a single stdlib-only harness maps 1:1 to each
  documented claim, prints its machine/Python/GIL context, and records
  runs in `benchmarks/RESULTS.md`. Deliberately **not** in CI: shared
  runners make wall-clock claims dishonest, so the lab is for humans
  re-verifying on their own hardware (`--json`, `--quick` flags; runs on
  free-threaded builds via `uv run --python 3.14t`).
- New: **executable documentation gates** — every ```python block in the
  user-facing docs (110 blocks across README, quickstart, cookbook, API
  reference, guides) is now CI-tested on three levels: it must compile
  (top-level `await` allowed), every keyword passed to a pyarallel
  callable must exist in the real signature (the gate that would have
  caught `batch_size=` lingering after the v0.8 rename), and the
  feasible pages — the flagship LLM recipe against a fake `openai`
  module, the streaming ETL page against a fake cursor — execute end to
  end as written. First run caught a real indentation bug in the
  bulk-download recipe.
- New: **public-API snapshot gate** — `tests/api_snapshot.txt` is a
  committed, human-readable rendering of every export, signature,
  method, and enum member; CI diffs the live surface against it, so an
  accidental API change is a red build and a deliberate one is a
  reviewed diff.
- Docs: **[Compatibility & Policies](https://oneryalcin.github.io/pyarallel/development/policies/)**
  — semver-from-1.0, deprecation windows, checkpoint file persistence
  guarantees (schema fail-closed, within-major readability, the pickle
  boundary), and the Python-version support policy. Stated before the
  freeze so 1.0 means something.
- New: **decorator defaults widened** — `@parallel` / `@async_parallel`
  accept `retry`, `timeout` (+ `task_timeout` async), `window_size`,
  `max_errors`, and `on_progress` as defaults: they are properties of
  the *function's behavior* ("this fetcher retries 429s") and the
  natural spelling `@parallel(retry=...)` previously raised TypeError.
  Per-call presence-sentinel semantics unchanged (unpassed inherits,
  explicit — even `None` — overrides). Deliberately excluded, loudly:
  `checkpoint`/`checkpoint_key`/`checkpoint_version` (a checkpoint file
  names a *run* — a shared default file means duplicate keys and wrong
  resumes) and `stop` (a token is a campaign latch). A collected-only
  `timeout` default is ignored by `.stream()` (streaming has no total
  deadline).
- Docs: the `AsyncClient`-per-item anti-pattern purged from README,
  quickstart, API reference, and cookbook — one client around the
  fan-out (connection pooling, TLS reuse), flagged since the first
  external review.
- Roadmap: v0.10 "Prove and package" section restored (benchmark lab,
  executable cookbook examples, compat/deprecation policy, API
  snapshot) — two of the original review's v0.10 items had been left
  under a "shipped" header.

## 0.9.0 — 2026-07-10 — the real-job release

- New: **the resilience demo** (`examples/resilience_demo.py`) — every
  headline claim proven locally in ~10s with zero credentials and zero
  extra dependencies (stdlib fake API + stdlib client): a full-speed
  pool draws a 429 and ONE `Retry-After` pauses the whole pool (gap
  measured server-side, ~1 wasted call instead of a per-worker storm);
  a client-side `RateLimit` prevents throttling entirely; a
  checkpointed run is SIGKILLed mid-flight and the rerun resumes from
  SQLite without repeating paid-for calls (server request counter as
  the receipt). Self-asserting — exits non-zero if any claim fails.
- New: **cooperative stop** — `stop=StopToken()` on the collected map
  APIs (`parallel_map` / `async_parallel_map` / decorator `.map()`;
  starmap keeps its smaller surface, streaming needs no token).
  `token.stop()` (thread-safe, idempotent, signal-handler-safe) ceases
  admission, cancels what can be cancelled, keeps completed checkpoint
  rows, and reports `RunStatus.CANCELLED`; unresolved items are marked
  with the new `Cancelled` exception and `values()`/iteration raise on
  the truncation like every stop. ~100ms cancel latency even while
  rate-limit-paced. Honest asymmetry: async cancels in-flight tasks;
  sync threads finish their current item in the background. Streaming
  APIs don't take a token — `break`/`aclose` already are cooperative
  stop.
- New: **`ParallelResult.item_results()`** — the per-item `attempts` and
  `duration` the workers already compute now survive a *collected* map,
  not just streaming. `parallel_map(...).item_results()` returns a
  `list[ItemResult[R]]` in input order — the same index/value/error/
  attempts/duration vocabulary `parallel_iter` yields — so a retry count
  or a latency budget is one call away without switching to streaming.
  Never raises (a partial-results accessor, like `.successes()`).
  Honest zeros where nothing ran *this* run: a checkpoint cache hit and
  a timeout/abort placeholder both carry `attempts=0, duration=0.0`. A
  hand-constructed `ParallelResult` has no metadata and synthesizes
  `attempts=1, duration=0.0`.
- New: **`checkpoint_version=`** — a user-supplied semantic token
  (`str`/`int`/`bytes` or a tuple: `("classify-v3", MODEL, PROMPT_SHA)`)
  joining checkpoint identity, for the config automatic function
  inspection cannot see. You change a prompt in a config file — the
  function's bytes are identical — and the checkpoint would silently
  stitch 40k old-prompt answers to 10k new ones; with the token, the
  rerun fails closed showing both versions. Stored readable in the
  checkpoint's meta table. Requires `checkpoint=`. Note: pyarallel
  < 0.9 doesn't read the token and resumes versioned files without
  enforcing it — the fence binds only on 0.9+ readers.
- New: **`AsyncIterable` sources** — `async_parallel_map` / `_starmap` /
  `_iter` (and the decorator `.map()`/`.starmap()`/`.stream()`) accept
  async sources directly: DB cursors, paginated API generators. No more
  draining a million-row cursor into a list to feed it back out —
  backpressure reaches the producer (one item pulled as one window slot
  frees), a stopped run never pulls from the source again, and an *idle*
  source is never touched — a pull in progress at a stop/close is
  cancelled (your `finally` runs; standard asyncio pipeline semantics);
  final closing stays the caller's job (`aclosing()`). In streaming,
  the pull races beside the workers, so a stalled page fetch delays
  only admission — completed results keep yielding. Bonus over sync
  sources: `timeout=` binds *during* a stuck source await — a dead
  paginator cannot outlive the deadline (unless it swallows
  cancellation). Sync iterables unchanged.
- New: **`Retry.for_http()`** — the 429/`Retry-After` dance, prewired
  and dependency-free. Handles both header dialects (numeric seconds
  *and* HTTP-date — homemade parsers routinely crash or stampede on the
  date form), falls back to exponential backoff on malformed values,
  and duck-types the response (httpx/requests `.response`, aiohttp's
  exception-is-the-response) with no HTTP client import. `statuses=`
  defaults to `{429, 503}`; statusless exceptions in `on=` (connection
  errors) are retried on the type filter alone. Returns a plain frozen
  `Retry`, so the shared-limiter pause and process-executor pickling
  compose unchanged. Cookbook recipes (LLM batch, embeddings, Docker
  registry) now use it; the GitHub recipe documents why its
  header-aware 403 logic can't (status alone can't distinguish
  throttling from no-permission).

## 0.8.0 — 2026-07-10 — the honest-contract release

One deliberate contract-breaking release before 1.0: everywhere the
public vocabulary lied, it now tells the truth. Full rationale and
review trail: `docs/development/plans/v0.8-honest-contract.md`.

**Breaking:**

- `batch_size` → **`window_size`** everywhere. It was always the
  admission window — the maximum number of unresolved items — never a
  chunk size. Passing `batch_size=` now raises `TypeError`.
  Migration: rename the keyword.
- **`result.ok` is now honest**: `True` only when the run *completed*
  (source exhausted) and every task succeeded. Previously an unsized
  run that hit `timeout=` could return only successful items and report
  `ok=True` — a silent truncation. `.values()`, iteration, and indexing
  now raise (`TimeoutError`/`Aborted`) on truncated runs; use
  `.successes()` / `.ok_values()` to consume partial results.
- `ParallelResult` is constructed with `status=RunStatus.…` instead of
  `timed_out=`/`aborted=` bools (constructor use is rare;
  `.timed_out`/`.aborted` remain as derived read properties).
- Decorator per-call **`None` now overrides** the decorator default
  instead of silently inheriting: `fetch.map(urls, rate_limit=None)`
  turns the decorator's rate limit off. Unpassed options inherit as
  before. `executor=None` / `concurrency=None` (previously no-op
  spellings of "inherit") are now type errors with clear runtime
  `ValueError`s.

  ⚠️ **Audit call sites that pass computed `None`s.** The common idiom

  ```python
  rl = user_limit or None            # "no override" ... in 0.7
  fetch.map(urls, rate_limit=rl)     # 0.8: DISABLES rate limiting
  ```

  inherited the decorator's rate limit in 0.7 and **silently disables
  it** in 0.8 — full-speed calls against a throttled API, discovered
  via 429s in production, not test failures. Same for `retry=None`
  (retries off). To mean "inherit", don't pass the keyword:

  ```python
  opts = {} if user_limit is None else {"rate_limit": user_limit}
  fetch.map(urls, **opts)
  ```
- `ItemResult(error=None)` — previously constructed a fake success — now
  raises `ValueError`; an explicitly passed `error` must be an
  `Exception` instance.
- `RateLimit` / `Retry` reject NaN, infinite, and negative numerics at
  construction (`RateLimit(float("nan"))` was silently accepted and
  poisoned the bucket math). Same rule on the engines: `timeout=` /
  `task_timeout=` must be finite and >= 0 (`timeout=float("nan")`
  silently disabled the deadline).
- `.values()`/iteration/indexing check truncation **before** per-item
  failures: a timed-out sized run raises `TimeoutError` (not an
  `ExceptionGroup` of placeholder markers), an aborted run raises
  `Aborted` — one exception surface per event, regardless of input
  sizing. `.failures()` keeps the per-item detail.

**New:**

- `RunStatus` (`COMPLETED` / `TIMED_OUT` / `ABORTED`) exported;
  `result.status` is the source of truth for how a run ended, and
  `result.complete` reports source exhaustion independently of item
  failures.
- `raise_on_failure()` attaches each failure's item index as a PEP 678
  note — provenance in tracebacks without changing exception types
  (`except* ConnectionError` matching untouched).
- Typed item binding: single-parameter functions get `.map()`/`.stream()`
  that check their input types in both mypy and pyright, through both
  decorator spellings. Multi-parameter `.starmap()` stays
  `tuple[Any, ...]` (a ParamSpec cannot be bound to a tuple type —
  prototyped, documented in the plan).
- Checkpoint files are created `0o600` at creation time (POSIX; existing
  files keep their permissions). Corrupted checkpoint rows raise
  `CheckpointError` with delete-to-start-fresh instructions instead of
  leaking raw unpickling errors. Docs now state the trust boundary:
  checkpoints contain pickle — treat the file like code.
- CI: wheel/sdist build + clean-install + py.typed gate, macOS/Windows
  smoke lanes, pyright on the typing assertions. Releases publish via
  PyPI trusted publishing (OIDC + attestations) on `v*` tags; manual
  twine uploads retired. Version single-sourced from
  `pyarallel/__init__.py`.

### Also in this release

- Docs: the single-page real-world guide is now a **Cookbook** — one
  recipe per page (each independently searchable/linkable), with four new
  recipes for workloads where repeating work is expensive or the rate
  budget is shared: bulk GitHub repo changes across an org, Docker
  registry tag cleanup, secrets rotation (identity-keyed resume so a
  crash never double-rotates), and batch NCBI/Entrez fetches. The old
  `user-guide/real-world-patterns/` URL redirects to the cookbook.
- Docs: publish `llms.txt` so AI assistants can ingest and cite the docs.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-07-06

**The parallelism-future bets.** Free-threaded CPython proven per-commit,
and a third executor for Python 3.14+.

- New: `executor="interpreter"` (Python 3.14+, PEP 734
  `InterpreterPoolExecutor`) — true CPU parallelism for pure-Python work
  on standard GIL builds, in one OS process, with ~30 ms workers instead
  of fork/spawn. Process constraint rules apply (importable module-level
  functions, picklable retry, no shared limiter, no contextvars), plus
  two interpreter-only rules: `__main__`-defined functions and
  `worker_init` are rejected upfront with an actionable error
  (sub-interpreters cannot see the parent's `__main__`), and
  `max_tasks_per_worker` is rejected (no worker recycling). Workers
  mirror the parent's `sys.path` — same behavior as multiprocessing
  spawn — so targets importable via runtime path additions resolve.
  Known boundary: C extensions without subinterpreter support (numpy
  among them) fail with `ImportError` inside workers; use
  `executor="process"` for those.
- The version gate lives on the pool path only: `sequential=True` with
  `executor="interpreter"` still runs inline on 3.12/3.13 — production
  configs stay one flag away from debuggable.
- `ExecutorType` widened to
  `Literal["thread", "process", "interpreter"]` — downstream code
  matching exhaustively on it will see the new member.
- CI now tests 3.14 and free-threaded 3.13t/3.14t (suite runs with the
  GIL off; a guard step fails the job if the GIL is silently re-enabled).
  New `test` dependency group for minimal installs.
- Docs: free-threading note (measured 2.4× CPU-bound at 4 workers on
  3.14t vs 1.0× under the GIL); interpreter executor guidance.
- Docs: new comparison page (vs the tenacity+ThreadPoolExecutor
  hand-roll, aiometer, mpire, joblib — including when *not* to use
  pyarallel) and two new recipes (batch LLM calls, CPU-bound fan-out).

## 0.6.0 — 2026-07-06

**One engine for every execution path.** All collected maps — sync and
async — now run through the same windowed engine that streaming and
`max_errors` already used. Behavior changes (pre-1.0, no deprecation
cycle):

- `batch_size` means one thing everywhere: the in-flight admission
  window (default `2 × workers` sync, `2 × concurrency` async). Chunk
  barriers no longer exist anywhere — a slow item never stalls the
  items behind it.
- Collected maps consume input lazily, one window ahead — generators
  are never materialized. The plain no-kwargs call moves from eager
  upfront submission to windowed admission (benchmarked: parity on
  ms-scale tasks; see the v0.6 plan for numbers).
- No-drain on stop, everywhere: after a timeout or abort the source
  iterator is never touched again. Unsized inputs return a *shorter*
  result instead of drained-and-appended failure placeholders.
- New: `ParallelResult.timed_out` / `.aborted` report how the run ended
  (at most one is set — first stop reason wins; both show up in the
  repr). This is the reliable truncation signal for unsized inputs,
  where a timed-out run can contain only successes.
- `on_progress` with unsized inputs reports items *admitted* so far as
  `total` (previously the final total, because input was materialized).
  Pass a sized input for a real total.
- Source-iterator errors surface mid-run instead of at materialization,
  and propagate promptly: queued work is cancelled, but sync tasks
  already running cannot be interrupted and may complete — side effects
  included — in the background. Materialize the input first
  (`list(items)`) if you need no-work-after-error guarantees, or use
  the async API (tasks are cancelled and awaited).
- Exception shape: errors raised from callbacks on the async plain path
  propagate plain — the `ExceptionGroup` wrapper went away with the
  removed `asyncio.TaskGroup`.
- `parallel_starmap` no longer materializes its input — generators of
  argument tuples stay lazy.
- Total `timeout=` now binds during cached checkpoint admission too: a
  checkpoint-heavy run can no longer overrun the deadline unnoticed.
- Fixed: a `TimeoutError` raised by the source iterable itself is an
  input error and propagates — it is no longer repackaged as deadline
  expiry.

## 0.5.0 — 2026-07-05

Structural quality: sliding-window streaming (`ordered=True`, streaming
`on_progress`), `max_errors` early abort, `ItemResult.attempts`/
`.duration`, `ParallelResult.ok_values()`, `checkpoint_key=` (schema v2),
`sequential=True` debug mode, async total `timeout=`, contextvars
propagation, `worker_init=`/`max_tasks_per_worker=`, typed decorator
options via `Unpack[TypedDict]`. Details:
[v0.5.0 Plan](docs/development/plans/v0.5.0.md). Not published to PyPI.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-06

Repositioned as the fan-out layer for rate-limited APIs: server-driven
backoff (`retry_if`/`wait_from`), shareable `Limiter`, real token bucket
(`burst=`), `checkpoint=` resume, strict typing. Tag only, not published.
